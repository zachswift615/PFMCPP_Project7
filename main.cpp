Project 7: Part 1/1
 video: Chapter 4 Part 2 

Create a branch named Part1

Purpose:  This project will teach you how to read existing code someone else has already written, and to get it working again.  Consider this project the "midterm" of the course.

 Inheritance and Composition
 
Build/Run often with this task to make sure you're not breaking the code with each step.
I recommend committing after you get each step working so you can revert to a working version easily if needed.
it's very easy to mess this task up. 

 It's time to get your inner Dungeons & Dragons nerd on!!
 
 1) Make the errors go away.

 2) Assertions have been added with text explaining the things you need to implement.  
        after you implement them, remove the 'assert(false);

 3) add the appropriate #include statements

 4) you're going to need to implement the pure virtual functions in Character-derived classes and Item classes
    
 5) implement the constructors for all the Character-derived types. 
        Dragon's attackDamage is 80
        DragonSlayer's attackDamage is 4
        Dwarf's attackDamage is 4
        Paladin's attackDamage is 10

 6) Each character type gets some Helpful Items and Defensive Items when they're constructed
        Use the functions in Utility.h to give each Character (excluding Dragon, because dragons don't carry items) a RANDOM NUMBER of helpful and defensive items: 
            helpfulItems = makeHelpfulItems(2);
            defensiveItems = makeDefensiveItems(1);
    
 7) create a new Item-derived type that boosts the attack damage called AttackItem 
        add an instance of it to the DragonSlayer class
        make the DragonSlayer::attack use it when the dragonSlayer attacks a dragon. 
        
 8) Clear the warnings as best you can.   
         for the 'vtables' warnings coming from a header file, move any virtual function implementations to the complementary cpp file.
         for 'shadow' warnings, rename the offending variable.
         casting is introduced in the next video and project, so ignore any 'implicit conversion' warnings.

 9) When you compare your output with the expected output, it is fine if the items counts don't match exactly.   It's not important if your DragonSlayer has 5 helpful items, but the expected output shows 3.
